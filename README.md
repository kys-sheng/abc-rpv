# abc-rpv
`abc-rpv` is a Python library that provides a framework for analyzing the collider signatures of RPV-MSSM studied in this paper and beyond. Users are provided with various functionalities to explore the landscape of RPV-MSSM physics within the context of small RPV-couplings.

To download library:
1. Go to green color button (Code): 
2. Download this git repository either via download as a zip 
3. or running `git clone https://github.com/kys-sheng/abc-rpv.git` 

To learn how to use:
1. Try Tutorial.ipynb

Feel free to provide feedback via the "Issues" section of the git repo.

## Future Updates:
1. Include possibility of produced sparticles different from LSP (Next Update)
2. Include charges of final state objects (Need to rewrite code base, in progress)
3. Using all possible exact vertices instead of not_suppressed table (Need to rewrite code base, in progress)
4. Generate Madgraph template param_card for parameter scans (Need to rewrite code base, in progress)
5. Incorporate code with large RPV cases
